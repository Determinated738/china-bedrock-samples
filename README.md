# China Minecraft Asset files

## What is this?

The following files are the resource and behavior files for Minecraft: China edition, operated by NetEase. These files are adapted for use within the China version of Minecraft and follow a similar format used in the international Bedrock Edition.

The official international repository for Bedrock Edition samples is available at [bedrock-samples](https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/). As of now, there is no official equivalent maintained for the China Edition. This project helps bridge that gap.

## Why does this exist?

To provide an easier way for users to access the latest game assets without needing to manually extract or locate them from the game files themselves.
